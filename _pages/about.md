Hello, my name is Thanakit Chobunsuwan, but you can call me Tee. I am a third-year student in Computer Engineering International Program at King Mongkutâ€™s University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT). I have a strong interest in software development, particularly in full-stack and mobile development. Currently, I am gaining experience through academic projects, internships, and extracurricular activities such as hackathons and teaching assistance.
